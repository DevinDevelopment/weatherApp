## Description

In this project we will focus on making a weather dashboard. This application will feature local storage in order to save a history of searched cities. Api calls will be made to get weather data from openWeather api. We will make Api calls when user types city in and selects search or when user selects one of the buttons that represent a past search. 

-In this project we learned the implementation of local storage for data storage and retrieval and the use of Api's to get live data.
